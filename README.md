## About this repository
This repository will provide a simple Python library to collect and filters research papers' metadata for conducting a systematic literature review following the Kitchenham framework. We still working on this and it will be published soon. In the meantime, you can use the original `Python notebook (ipynb)` version in this repository: https://github.com/okkyibrohim/slr-sa-in-ne
